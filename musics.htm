		Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. 
		The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, 
		as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. 
		When played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of many of their performances. 
		Currently, the band consists of founding members vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea (Michael Peter Balzary), 
		longtime drummer Chad Smith, and former touring guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.
		Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time with over 80 million records sold worldwide,
		have been nominated for sixteen Grammy Awards, of which they have won six, and are the most successful band in alternative rock radio history,
		currently holding the records for most number-one singles, most cumulative weeks at number one (85) and most top-ten songs (25) on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.
		In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
		<br><br>
		The band's original lineup, originally named Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem,
		featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.
		Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's self-titled debut album (1984).
		Slovak performed on the second and third albums, Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987),
		but he died from a heroin overdose in 1988. As a result of his friend's death, 
		Irons chose to leave the group. After short-lived replacements on guitar and drums,
		John Frusciante and Chad Smith joined in 1988. The lineup of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante,
		and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with Mother's Milk (1989).
		In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) under producer Rick Rubin.
		This album became the band's first major commercial success, but Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the band's popularity and left abruptly in 1992 in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour.
		<br><br>
		After two temporary guitarists, Dave Navarro joined the group in 1993 and played on their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). 
		Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik,
		selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998.[2] Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation,
		rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999),
		which became the band's biggest commercial success with 16 million copies sold worldwide.
		That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006),
		their first number-one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus.
		Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band in 2009 to focus on his solo career. Klinghoffer, 
		who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects,
		replaced him. The band's tenth studio album, I'm with You, was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries.
		The band released their eleventh studio album, The Getaway, in 2016. The album was produced by Danger Mouse, 
		marking the first time since Mother's Milk that the Red Hot Chili Peppers had not worked with Rubin,
		and topped the charts in ten different countries. As of November 2018, the band is in the process of working on their twelfth studio album which they expect to release in 2019.

		The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971.
		The founding members were Glenn Frey (guitars, vocals), Don Henley (drums, vocals), 
		Bernie Leadon (guitars, vocals) and Randy Meisner (bass guitar, vocals). 
		With five number-one singles, six Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards,
		and six number-one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. 
		At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) 
		and Hotel California, were ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the United States according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
		By 2006, both albums were among the top three best-selling albums in the United States.
		Hotel California is ranked 37th in Rolling Stone's list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"
		and the band was ranked number 75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.
		<br><br>
		The Eagles are one of the world's best-selling bands in history,
		having sold more than 100 million albums worldwide.120 million in the U.S. alone.
		Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) is the number one selling album in the US with more than 38 million album units in sales 
		and streams and Hotel California is the third best selling album with more than 26 million album units in sales and streams.
		Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) was the best selling album of the 20th century in the U.S.
		They are the fifth-highest-selling music act and the highest-selling American band in U.S. history.
		<br><br>
		The band released their debut album, Eagles, in 1972, which spawned three top 40 singles:
		"Take It Easy", "Witchy Woman", and "Peaceful Easy Feeling". Their next album, Desperado (1973), was less successful than the first, only reaching number 41 on the charts; 
		neither of its singles reached the top 40. However, the album does contain what would go on to be two of the band's most popular tracks:
		"Desperado" and "Tequila Sunrise". The band released On the Border in 1974, adding guitarist Don Felder as the fifth member midway through the recording of the album.
		The album generated two top 40 singles: "Already Gone" and their first number one, "Best of My Love".
		<br><br>
		Their 1975 album One of These Nights included three top 10 singles: 
		"One of These Nights", "Lyin' Eyes", and "Take It to the Limit", 
		the first hitting the top of the charts. Guitarist and vocalist Joe Walsh also joined the band in 1975 replacing Leadon.
		The Eagles continued that success and hit their commercial peak in late 1976 with the release of Hotel California, 
		which would go on to sell more than 26 million copies in the U.S. alone and more than 42 million copies worldwide.
		The album yielded two number-one singles, "New Kid in Town" and "Hotel California".
		Meisner left the band in 1977 and was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit. They released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with The Long Run,
		which spawned three top 10 singles: "Heartache Tonight", "The Long Run", and "I Can't Tell You Why", 
		the lead single being another chart-topping hit.
		<br><br>
		The Eagles disbanded in July 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album Hell Freezes Over,
		a mix of live and new studio tracks. They toured consistently and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. 
		In 2007, the Eagles released Long Road Out of Eden, their first full studio album in 28 years and their sixth number-one album.
		The next year they launched the Long Road Out of Eden Tour in support of the album. In 2013, 
		they began the extended History of the Eagles Tour in conjunction with the band's documentary release, 
		History of the Eagles.

		<strong> R.E.M. - Losing My Religion </strong>

		R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry,
		guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe.
		One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, 
		arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' 
		melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. 
		R.E.M. released its first single—"Radio Free Europe"—in 1981 on the independent record
		label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first
		release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut
		album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent
		releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of 
		underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single 
		"The One I Love". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to
		espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.
		<br><br>
		By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, 
		R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the
		genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time 
		(1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established
		sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a 
		return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band 
		began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical
		emergencies suffered by three of the band members.
		<br><br>
		In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time
		the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in 
		Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. 
		The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued
		the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its 
		career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having 
		sold more than 85 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling
		music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall
		of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011,
		announcing the split on its website.
